## PR Checklist

#### General Checks

- [ ] Have you ran appropriate tests (unit/integration/end-to-end) to check logic in all run environments (Conda/Docker/Singularity on Scicomp/AWS/NF Tower/Local)? For each relevant configuration:
* Can the program run completely through without erroring out?
* Does it produce the expected outputs, given the inputs provided? 

- [ ] Have you conducted proper linting procedures: 
* Numpy formatted docstrings for functions
* Comments explaining lines of code
* Consistent and intuitive naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, methods, attributes, and scripts
* Single empty line between class functions, two lines between non-class functions, and two lines between imports and code body
* Camel case formatting for class names
